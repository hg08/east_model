# east_model
This function generate time series of the east model and calcualte the auto-correlation function of the spins.

1. For a fixed $N$, calculate and compare the autocorrelation function of occupation number for different $\beta$.

2. For a fixed $\beta$, calculate and compare the autocorrelation function of occupation number for different $N$. 

3. Calculate dynamical average of $h(t)$, and then determine the time at which the system is in equilibrium.

4. Compare the result to Ref..
